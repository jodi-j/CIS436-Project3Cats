Welcome to The Cat App, which is a cat fact app for CIS436! Our group members include Firas Abueida, Jodi Joven, and Souad Omar. This app allows you to learn more about various cat breeds by selecting a cat breed option from a spinner. Upon selecting your choice, the screen will display various facts about your chosen cat!
